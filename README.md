This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Test

If you need to run it locally first you need to get the uplus_node server running in your local computer
If you don't want to clone the server then at the LoansActions files comment the line for localhost and
uncomment the one to my server
I did have a hard time accesing the zonky api so I created the nest route to get the data I needed for the app.
I used typescript to enforce type checking to avoid issues.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
